# Annotations Converter
This repo contains code to convert annotations from xml format to csv and txt format. CSV format is used for Faster RCNN pytorch and TXT is used for YOLOv5. You can make modifications as per the requirements.

# How to Use
Move the python code to the file where you have annotations in xml format and simply run the python file to get into other formats.
